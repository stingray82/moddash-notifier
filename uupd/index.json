        "frequently_asked_questions": "= How do I add use the plugin? =<br />\r\nYou need to call the required functions in Flowmattic or your Automator of choice as needed<br />\r\n<br />\r\n= Why does ModDash Notifier only work with the community-post post type? =<br />\r\nModDash Notifier was built for SureDash-powered communities, which use the community-post custom post type for discussions. This focus ensures that notifications are only sent for the relevant comments moderators care about, rather than every comment on your WordPress site.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n= Can I use ModDash Notifier with regular WordPress comments or blog posts =<br />\r\nNo. The plugin is designed to trigger only for comments on community-post items. It won\u2019t activate for standard WordPress posts or other content types to avoid unnecessary notifications outside your SureDash workflow.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n= How do I connect ModDash Notifier to Slack or Discord for comment alerts? =<br />\r\nGo to Settings \u2192 Discussion in your WordPress dashboard. Under the Slack and Discord sections, check Enable and paste your Incoming Webhook URL. Once saved, new pending comments on community-post items will appear in those channels with action buttons for quick moderation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n= Do moderators need special permissions to receive and act on notifications =<br />\r\nYes. Only WordPress users with the moderate_comments capability can be selected as notification recipients. This ensures only authorized moderators can approve, unapprove, mark as spam, or trash comments from email, Slack, or Discord links.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n= How fast will notifications be delivered after a comment is posted? =<br />\r\nNotifications are queued and sent by WP-Cron approximately 15 seconds after a comment is submitted. This keeps comment submissions fast for visitors while ensuring moderators get near real-time alerts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n= What happens if a moderator clicks an action link but isn\u2019t logged in? = <br />\r\nIf you\u2019re not logged in when clicking a moderation link, the plugin will redirect you to the login page and then return you to the requested action. It also regenerates a fresh, secure nonce so the action can complete successfully after login.",
